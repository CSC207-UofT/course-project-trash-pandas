## For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:
    

###  equitable use
    

-   The design is simple and very straightforward, should be appealing to most, if not all users
    
-   [not implemented] translations into multiple languages, could implement by implementing the text / dialogue into a file, could store different languages into that file/one file for each language, and we can allow language selection
    
-   [not implemented] for blind users, we could provide a text-to-speech / narrator and some sort of sound/music for blind users to also have an immersive experience. We could then implement selecting options through the arrow keys so that a blind user wouldn’t need to know where to press.
    

###   flexibility in use
    

-   can fit a variety of screen sizes
    
-   Users can choose to do which quests, not linear, they just have a list that they can accept, so they have a choice in what order they do the quests [may possibly not do this???]
    
-   Left-handedness / right-handedness doesn’t apply accomodation to the game, since users are providing inputs with their own input devices
    
-   Facilitate user’s accuracy/precision by providing large buttons and a large textbook for users to click, they could click anywhere within the buttons and it would register as a valid input
    

###   simple and intuitive use
    

-   main buttons have simple functions clearly represented by button text
    
-   Although the buttons / textbox element of the program is straightforward, currently, we don’t provide a tutorial for the user. This could be done by explaining what each button does / giving the user a tutorial quest
    
-   Prompting is provided in the textbox, we could add something that prompted in the main text window instead, since the text is larger, we could also provide a prompt that says ‘task completed!’
    

###   perceptible information
    

-   large, easily visible text on high-contrast background making it easy to read
    
-   [not implemented] narrator / text-to-speech for the text being displayed on the screen
    
-   [not implemented] text-size slider
    
-   Use verbal(text) and tactile (buttons) to present information
    

###  tolerance for error
    

-   [not implemented] save/load confirmation
    
-   We could add a confirmation for users that wish to equip equipment that is worse than their current equipment: if the user currently has a weapon with 15 attack points and they click that they want to equip a weapon with 5 attack points, we can provide a warning that says ‘the weapon you want to equip is worse than your current equipped weapon, are you sure?’ and then ask the user for confirmation
    
-   Provide warnings for harder quests if the user has low level equipment equipped
    

###  low physical effort
    

-   basic options available with single click
    
-   [not implemented] numbered menus
    
-   Text is large and easy to read, so users don’t need to lean forwards and can sit in a comfortable and neutral body position
    
-   Minimized repetitive actions by making majority of inputs a button instead of needing to type in a textbox,
    

### size and space for approach and use
    

-   large, easily visible text on high-contrast background (ensuring visibility from multiple angles)
    
-   resizable screen
    
-   Hand /grip size doesn’t apply, since the user is providing inputs with their own mouse and keyboard
    

##  Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.
    

If we were to sell our program, we’d likely market it towards people who want to relive the experience of playing old turn based role playing games. Specifically, other than people who only enjoy major online games, this game would suit people who enjoy playing much smaller indie/single player games that have interesting storylines for them to play through. Most customers would be students or even people up to the mid 30s, since games are mostly played by younger students and older generations of game maniacs who constantly look for time-killing rpg games can often be seen as well. Even those older may enjoy our game since it draws inspiration from older text based games.

## Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.
    

Our program would be less likely to be used by the dyslexic or illiterate due to our program’s heavy reliance on written text (which is the main form of output). Because the text of the game is written in the English language, our program also discourages use by those not fluent or comfortable with the use of English. It would also not be used by demographics not familiar with computer use or with electronic games, such as infants or the elderly (our program assumes some level of familiarity with the RPG format and does not include a tutorial or similar introductory material), or by demographics that do not have access to computers or otherwise have no interest in playing computer games, such as the homeless or forcibly displaced persons. Furthermore, the background music present in the game will make it less accessible to the hard of hearing.
